    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, instead of using the traditional table-based relational database structure used in SQL databases. \n",
    "It was developed to handle large-scale, high-volume data processing and is designed to be highly scalable and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that don't follow the traditional relational model used in SQL databases. \n",
    "They don't use tables with fixed columns and rows to store data, but rather use flexible data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, and columns. \n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to handle big data and scale horizontally, making them a preferred choice for web applications and large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and scalability are required: \n",
    "MongoDB's flexible data model makes it easy to scale horizontally and add or modify data fields as needed without requiring any schema changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large volumes of unstructured data: \n",
    "MongoDB is designed to handle unstructured data such as text, images, and videos, which are difficult to store in a traditional SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "High write loads: \n",
    "MongoDB's sharding and replication features make it ideal for high-write workloads, where data is constantly being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile development: \n",
    "MongoDB's flexible data model and lack of rigid schema make it easy to adapt to changing business requirements, which is ideal for agile development processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and agility for handling large volumes of unstructured data and high-write workloads. \n",
    "It is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where these features are required, and where a traditional relational model is not suitable."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers several key features that make it a preferred choice for modern application development. \n",
    "Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented data model: \n",
    "MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to store and access complex data structures. \n",
    "This is in contrast to SQL databases, which store data in rigid, tabular structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic schema: \n",
    "MongoDB doesn't require a predefined schema for data, allowing developers to add, modify or remove fields as needed. \n",
    "This feature is ideal for applications that need to adapt quickly to changing business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Horizontal scalability: \n",
    "MongoDB's sharding feature allows it to distribute data across multiple servers and scale horizontally, making it suitable for large-scale data processing and high-volume applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing:\n",
    "MongoDB supports various types of indexing, including geospatial, text, and hash-based indexes, which enable faster query execution and data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Aggregation framework:\n",
    "MongoDB offers a powerful aggregation framework that allows developers to perform complex data analysis and processing using a pipeline of stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Full-text search:\n",
    "MongoDB offers a powerful full-text search feature that enables text search on large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ID transactions: \n",
    "MongoDB now supports multi-document ACID transactions, which provides a high level of data integrity and consistency, ensuring that changes made to multiple documents are committed atomically."
